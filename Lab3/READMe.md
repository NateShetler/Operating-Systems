# Operating Systems Lab 3 - Nathaniel Shetler

### Quick Project Description

This project simulates a basic filesystem. The program uses the floppya.img file to simulate a floppy disk. It allows users to write files to the disk, remove files 
from the disk, read files from a disk, and print out a list of files present on the disk. The project description, starter file, and requirements were provided by 
Dr. O'Neil.
